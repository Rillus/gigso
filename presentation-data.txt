This is a story about the web, music and how far we've come, and what's possible now.<br><br>I'm Riley and I've been making websites for over 20 years. I also love listening to and playing music when I'm not coding. While I'm not what most people would call a proper musician, I am in a band: the John Lewis Partnership Ukulele Band (Also known as The PUB), and they'll feature in this story a bit.",

Although the CD was launched in 1982, it wasn't until we could start reading that data in a computer that things got interesting. This ushered in the age of what we then called Multimedia.<br><br>Although there was an arms race of companies vying to provide options for playing audio and video on the web (and there were many potential contenders in this race), the launch of Flash in 1996 marked a turning point, allowing for more complex audio and video content to be created and played back on the web.<br><br>This was a golden age of unsolicited musical and animated intros to websites that made the web both a joy and a hazard to navigate for around 10 years, before the Internet started to grow up and be these interludes became blockers to search engine optimisation and to users being able to complete tasks.<br><br>Around 2008, we got the first release of HTML5, which included the audio element tag, allowing us to embed audio files into web pages.<br><br>And then it wasn't until 2011 that we got the Web Audio API, which allowed for more complex audio to be created and played back on the web. <br><br>This led to the launch of the first web-based DAW (digital audio workstation - which is to a certain extent what we're talking about in this talk), Soundtrap.<br><br>Finally, in 2020, Adobe Flash was discontinued, in part because of the ability to navtively embed multimedia elements into the web, and also in part because Apple wouldn't allow Flash to be used on iOS devices.",

Radiohed's Creep. Let's see how it sounds.<br>- play 4 chords and loop via loop pedal.<br>- So I thought this would be pretty useful for The Partner Ukulele Band: we could share songs via here and have a nice little library of songs to play. Let's update the instrument to ukulele and see how that sounds next. (play the four chords in to the looper on the uke)<br>- If you're anything like me, you have a mandolin that yougot one year for your birthday, and you don't play it very often because there aren't many mandolin tabs or chord sheets online. What if you could play the chords on the mandolin? (play the four chords on the mandolin)<br>- I'd got about this far when my sister asked if I wanted to support my neices and teach some ukulele lessons at a day festival called Priory Live in Orpington to raise money for the Orpington May Queen, and as I already had some of the framework and components, my alter ego Unclelele was born, which I was able to set up within about a day.

This was much more akin to vibe coding than traditional development, with less code oversight.<br>- More recently, I've been using specification driven development, writing the specifications first, and then the implementation. I've been broadly using Claude Code to write the specifications, and then let it auto-run the implementation, and making sure we have good test coverage in place. Then for more fine-grained tweaks and design changes, I've been jumping back into Cursor. I'll be chatting a bit more about Specification Driven Development at the Engineering With Purpose external meetup on the 1st October.",
