# Chord Palette Test Plan

## Current Test Coverage Analysis

### ✅ Existing Tests
- Basic rendering (34 chord buttons)
- Event dispatching (`add-chord` event)

### ❌ Missing Test Coverage

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests - Current Functionality

#### Rendering Tests
- [ ] All chord buttons render correctly
- [ ] Chord buttons have correct data attributes
- [ ] Grid layout positions chords correctly
- [ ] CSS classes applied correctly for different chord types
- [ ] Styling differences between major/minor/sharp/flat chords

#### Event Tests
- [ ] `add-chord` event dispatched with correct data
- [ ] `chord-selected` event dispatched with correct data
- [ ] Event details contain correct chord information
- [ ] Events bubble up correctly

#### Styling Tests
- [ ] Major chords have correct styling
- [ ] Minor chords have correct styling
- [ ] Sharp chords positioned correctly
- [ ] Flat chords positioned correctly
- [ ] Hover effects work correctly

### 2. Unit Tests - New Key Selection Feature

#### Key Detection Tests
- [ ] `extractRootNote()` extracts correct root from chord names
- [ ] Handles major chords (C → C)
- [ ] Handles minor chords (Cm → C)
- [ ] Handles sharp chords (C# → C#)
- [ ] Handles flat chords (Bb → Bb)
- [ ] Handles complex chords (C#m → C#)

#### Scale Type Detection Tests
- [ ] `determineScaleType()` correctly identifies major chords
- [ ] `determineScaleType()` correctly identifies minor chords
- [ ] Handles edge cases and invalid inputs

#### State Management Tests
- [ ] `setKeyFromChord()` updates state correctly
- [ ] State changes trigger re-rendering
- [ ] State persists across component lifecycle

#### Visual Feedback Tests
- [ ] Key chord highlighting works
- [ ] Key indicator displays current key
- [ ] Visual changes are applied correctly
- [ ] Reset functionality works

#### Event Communication Tests
- [ ] `key-changed` event dispatched correctly
- [ ] `key-set` event dispatched on first selection
- [ ] Event data contains correct key and scale information
- [ ] Events bubble up to document level

### 3. Integration Tests

#### Component Communication Tests
- [ ] Hand-pan receives key change events
- [ ] Fretboard receives key change events
- [ ] Song sheet receives key change events
- [ ] State remains consistent across components

#### User Workflow Tests
- [ ] First chord selection sets key
- [ ] Subsequent chord selections change key
- [ ] Key changes update all connected components
- [ ] Visual feedback updates across all components

### 4. Edge Case Tests

#### Input Validation Tests
- [ ] Invalid chord names handled gracefully
- [ ] Missing chord data handled gracefully
- [ ] Malformed events handled gracefully

#### State Edge Cases
- [ ] Multiple rapid key changes
- [ ] Key changes before component ready
- [ ] State reset scenarios

#### Browser Compatibility Tests
- [ ] Custom elements work correctly
- [ ] Shadow DOM functionality
- [ ] Event dispatching works across browsers

### 5. Performance Tests

#### Rendering Performance
- [ ] Component renders within acceptable time
- [ ] Re-rendering on key changes is efficient
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable

#### Event Performance
- [ ] Event dispatching doesn't cause performance issues
- [ ] Multiple event listeners don't slow down component

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhance Existing Tests
1. Expand current test file with missing functionality
2. Add comprehensive event testing
3. Add styling and layout tests

### Phase 2: Add Key Selection Tests
1. Create new test file for key selection feature
2. Add unit tests for key detection functions
3. Add state management tests

### Phase 3: Add Integration Tests
1. Create integration test file
2. Test component communication
3. Test user workflows

### Phase 4: Add Edge Case Tests
1. Add input validation tests
2. Add error handling tests
3. Add browser compatibility tests

## Test Data Requirements

### Mock Data
- Complete chord library with all variations
- Mock state management system
- Mock event system
- Mock DOM environment

### Test Scenarios
- Happy path: Normal key selection workflow
- Edge cases: Invalid inputs, rapid changes
- Error scenarios: Component failures, state corruption
- Integration scenarios: Multi-component interactions

## Success Criteria

### Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: 95%+ code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All major user workflows covered
- **Edge Cases**: All identified edge cases tested
- **Performance**: All performance requirements met

### Quality Targets
- All tests pass consistently
- Tests run in under 30 seconds
- Tests are maintainable and readable
- Tests catch regressions effectively

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Must Have)
1. Key detection and scale type detection
2. State management integration
3. Event communication
4. Basic visual feedback

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
1. Comprehensive styling tests
2. Integration with other components
3. Edge case handling
4. Performance optimization

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Advanced visual effects testing
2. Browser compatibility testing
3. Accessibility testing
4. Advanced performance testing

## Conclusion

The current test coverage is insufficient for both existing functionality and the new key selection feature. We need to implement comprehensive testing across all categories to ensure reliability and maintainability.

The test plan should be implemented in phases, starting with enhancing existing tests and then adding new functionality tests. This will ensure we have a solid foundation before adding the complex key selection feature.
