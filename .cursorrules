# Cursor Rules for Gigso Project

## Project Overview
Gigso is a web-based music creation application built with vanilla JavaScript, Web Components, and Tone.js. The project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and uses British English conventions.

## Documentation Reference
**ALWAYS** refer to `documents/PRD.md` for:
- Feature specifications and requirements
- Technical architecture details
- Coding standards and conventions
- Data structures and interfaces
- UI/UX guidelines

**ALWAYS** refer to `documents/COMPONENT-SPECIFICATIONS.md` for:
- Component inputs, outputs, and expected behaviour
- Event communication patterns
- Integration requirements
- Testing specifications

**ALWAYS** refer to individual component files in `documents/components/` for:
- Detailed component specifications
- Specific implementation details
- Component-specific testing requirements

## Coding Standards (British English)
- Use British English spelling and terminology
- Follow TDD: Write tests before implementation
- Use ES6 modules (import/export)
- Follow kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes, camelCase for functions
- Extend BaseComponent for all Web Components
- Use CustomEvent for component communication

## Component Development
- All components must extend BaseComponent
- Include tests in `__tests__/` folders
- Use isolated styles with Shadow DOM
- Follow the event-driven architecture pattern
- Reference PRD for component specifications

## State Management
- Use centralised state in `state/state.js`
- Follow getter/setter pattern
- Maintain immutability where possible
- Reference PRD for state structure

## Testing Requirements
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Use Jest with jsdom environment
- Test all component interactions
- Maintain high test coverage
- Follow naming convention: `component-name.test.js`
- **CRITICAL**: Never use the watch mode of the test command (`npm test` without specific file) - this blocks progression
- Always run specific test files: `npm test -- path/to/test-file.test.js`

## Audio Implementation
- Use Tone.js for all audio functionality
- Follow PRD performance requirements
- Implement proper error handling for audio operations
- Reference PRD for audio data structures

## File Organisation
- Follow the structure defined in PRD
- Keep components in `components/` directory
- Place tests alongside components
- Use appropriate naming conventions

## Cloudflare Pages Deployment
**CRITICAL**: This project is deployed on Cloudflare Pages as a static site at https://gigso.pages.dev

### Deployment Configuration Files
- `_headers` - Sets MIME types and security headers for proper file serving
- `_redirects` - Controls URL routing (currently redirects root `/` to `/index.html`)

### Important Deployment Rules
1. **Never use `/*` redirects** - This breaks subdirectory access (like `/demos/`)
2. **Always set proper MIME types** in `_headers` for CSS and JS files
3. **Static sites with ES6 modules** must be served over HTTP/HTTPS, not `file://`
4. **CSS files** must have `Content-Type: text/css`
5. **JavaScript files** must have `Content-Type: application/javascript`

### Common Issues
- MIME type errors occur when server returns HTML instead of CSS/JS
- Redirect loops happen with overly broad `/*` redirects
- ES6 modules fail when served with wrong MIME types
- Subdirectory access breaks with root-level redirects

### Testing Deployment
- Always test locally with a web server (not `file://` protocol)
- Use `npx serve .` or `python3 -m http.server 8000` for local testing
- Verify MIME types are correct in browser dev tools
- Check that subdirectories like `/demos/` are accessible

## When Making Changes
1. **First**: Check PRD for existing specifications
2. **Update PRD** if specifications are incomplete or missing
3. **Follow TDD**: Write tests first
4. **Use British English** in all code and comments
5. **Reference PRD** for data structures and interfaces
6. **Maintain consistency** with existing codebase patterns
7. **Test deployment configuration** when changing `_headers` or `_redirects`

## AI Assistant Guidelines
- Always check `documents/PRD.md` before implementing features
- Update the PRD if you discover missing or incomplete specifications
- Follow British English conventions throughout
- Implement TDD approach for all new features
- Maintain the established architecture patterns
- Reference the PRD for any architectural decisions
- **CRITICAL**: When working with deployment files (`_headers`, `_redirects`), ensure proper MIME types and avoid overly broad redirects
- **CRITICAL**: Never run `npm test` without specifying a test file - this starts watch mode and blocks progression
